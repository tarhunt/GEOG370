    <body>Question: How do buffers help with spatial analysis?
    <body>For this map, I was curious about how space can be used especially along freeways. I found data for bikeways and road centerlines and created buffers to illustrate the proximity of these places to national forestry. In addition, I used intersection to focus on Montgomery. These buffers can help with putting barriers to keep wildlife from nearing dangerous roads.</body>

    <body>Research Question: How do buffers help with urban planning?
     <br>
     <h3>Background</h3>
    <body>Prior to creating this map, I used a number of geoprocessing techniques to reduce the data to work at the scale of Montgomery County. I used the projection 32119 and altered the data into 32119 for a more accurate reading. I was interested in how we can use buffers to help with urban planning. I found data for bikeways and road centerlines and created buffers to illustrate the proximity of these places to national forestry. These buffers can help with putting barriers to keep wildlife from nearing dangerous roads.</body>

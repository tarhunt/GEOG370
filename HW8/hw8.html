    <body>Research Question: How do buffers help with urban planning and wildlife conservation?
     <br>
     <h3>Background</h3>
    <body>Prior to creating this map, I used a number of geoprocessing techniques to work on the scale of Montgomery County. I used the projection 32119 and altered the data into 32119 for a more accurate reading. In addition, I used intersection for several data sets including the waterbodies, watershed, national forests I was interested in how we can use buffers to help with urban planning and wildlife conservtation. I found data for bikeways and road centerlines and created buffers to illustrate the proximity of these places to forestry. In addition, I added the national forests layer to illustrate the locations of these places are. By using these buffers, they can help with putting barriers to keep wildlife from nearing dangerous roads.</body>

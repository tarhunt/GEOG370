    <h2>Tarleton Hunt</h2>
    <body>
    <body>For this map, I found the daily 8-hour ozone concentration in South Carolina. In addition, I added the railroads in South Carolina to see if there was a coorelation between railroads and ozone levels. From this map, it does look like there is a coorelation between the two. In places with numerous interections, there are higher ozone concentration levels.</body>

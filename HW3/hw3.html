    <h2>Homework #3: World Projections</h2>
    <h3>Aitoff Projection</h3>

    <body>
       <p> There is a lot of distortion as the circles near the poles and become more like ellipses. In addition, there is much distortion on the sides of the projection which gives the projection as a whole, a globe like shape.</p>

    <h3>WGS84</h3>

        <p>Conserves its shape, but the area is highly distorted. For example, the area of Greenland is very large compared to Noth America and other countries.</p>

    <h3>World Robinson</h3>

    <br> 
    <p>There is a distortion on the area because the circles get bigger as we move towards the poles. In addition, the cirles are becoming more like ellipses as they near the poles.<p>

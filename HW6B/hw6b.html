    <h3> Map 1: Men per 100 Individuals<h3>
    <body> For this map, I divided the total number of men by the total poplation and multiplied by 100. Therefore this choloropleth illustrates the number of men per 100 individuals in each county in North Carolina. In addition, I used natural breaks classification. This method is designed to optimize the arrangement of a set of values into "natural" classes.<body>

    <h3>Map 2: 20-24 Year Olds in North Carolina</h3>
    <br>
    <body>For this map, I divided the total number of 20-24 year olds by the total population and multiplied by 100. Therefore this choloropleth illustrates the number of 20-24 year olds per 100 individuals in each county. In addition, I used the equal interval classification. This method divides the attribute values into equal size ranges. One advantage is that the data can easily be interpreted. One disadvantage is that it fails to consider how data is distributed along the number line. <body>

    <h3>Map 3: 75-84 Year Olds in North Carolina
    <br>
    <body> In this I divided total number of 75-84 year olds by the total population and multiplied by 100,000. I used equal count to illustrate this map. This is bad becasue it can show inconsistent data because irregularly distributed data.<body>
